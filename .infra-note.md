# Infrastructure Configuration

## Caddy Configuration

Caddy web server configuration is managed in the **exterminator-infra** repository:

🔗 https://github.com/akpandeya/exterminator-infra

This repository (`lingodrift`) only deploys application code:
- Frontend → `/var/www/lingodrift/` (staging) or `/var/www/lingodrift-prod/` (production)
- Backend → `/home/ubuntu/lingodrift-app/` (Docker containers)

## Adding/Modifying Routes

To add or modify Caddy configuration for lingodrift.com or staging.lingodrift.com:

1. Go to the exterminator-infra repository
2. Edit `caddy/Caddyfile`
3. Commit and push
4. GitHub Actions will auto-deploy the new configuration

## Why the Separation?

**Before:** Each application repo deployed its own Caddyfile, causing conflicts and overwriting other sites' configurations.

**Now:** Infrastructure (Caddy, SSL, etc.) is centralized in one repo, while application repos focus solely on deploying code.

This follows Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices.
